### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Anson. I am a recent Physics graduate from Imperial College London and now I am working as a Data Analytics Consultant in London.

I am experienced in applying numerical and machine learning algorithms to Physics problems. 

Project experiences include:
- **Masters Project**: Particle Event Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks.
  - Developed a novel 2-dimensional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to simulate particle events in detectors, using
projected spatial and energy data.
- A log-likelihood fit for extracting neutrino oscillation parameters
  - Developed optimisation algorithms to calculate neutrino parameters
-
